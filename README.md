# Mail server with spam filtering
This is docker image for self hosting an IMAP mail server pulling emails from remote IMAP or POP3 mail server. Multiple local and remote accounts are supported as are spam and rule based filtering. It is possible in example to pull emails from one account at remote server and write them to multiple local IMAP accounts and/or folders based on given rules. Please notice that this image does not contain SMTP server so container cannot receive emails or send them out, only pulling emails is possible (this is by design and won't change, hosting self hosting SMTP server is too hairy business for me).
